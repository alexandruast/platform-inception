Nomad vs K8s:
  Nomad rides on a different philosophy. It is only a scheduler, and it does it
  very well. Instead of offering tons of features, it strips the architecture of
  microservices to the bones and then offers the minimum and sufficient to schedule
  basically anything.
  If needed to ride on the (hyped) K8s bandwagon, I would personally vote for Rancher.

Servers - new instance every time a change is made vs. in-place updates:
  This is actually a pets vs cattle debate. I think it's best to make use of both.
  Does it make sense to degrade a cluster and reconfigure network just to install a package?
  Hell, NO! I know it's cool (and hype) to make things fail, but my focus is Production.
  Until my focus shifts, my job is to make sure those systems are as stable as possible.
